      <p class="ea-block">
        The EnTrus System is a <strong>bridge</strong> between your inner life and the physical world. It does this by
        turning abstract ideas  guardians, frequencies, alignment  into:
      </p>
      <p class="ea-block">
         clothing you can wear<br />
         beads and bracelets you can touch<br />
         activation cards you can read and breathe with<br />
         panels and scripts that keep the whole engine honest
      </p>

      <div class="ea-section-label">2  Main components</div>
      <div class="ea-grid">
        <article class="ea-card">
          <div class="ea-tag">Apparel</div>
          <h2>Hoodies, tees, joggers, hats</h2>
          <p>
            Each piece is tied to a frequency line (396, 528, 639, 741, 852, 285, Fusion 888) with sigil placement rules,
            phrases, and color logic. The job of apparel is to anchor a role into your normal day: protector, flow,
            connection, expression, seer, or foundation.
          </p>
          <p>
            The website holds product pages, options, cart behavior, and image pipelines so you can manage these pieces
            like a real catalog.
          </p>

          <div class="ea-tag">Beads &amp; bracelets</div>
          <h2>Frequency lines on the wrist</h2>
          <p>
            Beads carry frequency codes, color paths, and placement logic (broadcast vs receive, anchor stones, spacers).
            Bracelets like the Transfusion piece also serve as <em>fusion channels</em> joining multiple lines in one design.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the system, bracelets are treated as products with their own cards, renders, and activation flows.

        <article class="ea-card">
          <div class="ea-tag">Activation cards</div>
          <h2>Short rituals, no pretending</h2>
          <p>
            Each card gives a small breath sequence and intent statement for a specific piece. The card does not cause
            anything by itself  it simply gives the wearer a moment to choose: how do I want to show up while I have
            this on?
          </p>
          <p>
            Technically, cards are HTML pages plus images rendered through the pipeline and synced into the site.

          <div class="ea-tag">Frequencies &amp; guardians</div>
          <h2>Language for roles and patterns</h2>
          <p>
            Frequencies give you a simple numberphrase pairing for different ways of being. Guardians give you names
            for how the system watches itself: structure, flow, signal, color, coherence.
          </p>
          <p>
            These maps live in <code>frequencies.html</code> and <code>guardian_council.html</code>, and they inform how
            you design new products and stories.

          <h2>Creator Panel, scripts, and checks</h2>
          <p>
            The Creator Panel is your local cockpit. It links out to scripts that check pages, sync renders, and keep
            assets in the right folders. Auris sits here in concept  watching for drift, signaling when something
            breaks, helping you keep all green.
          </p>
          <p>
            None of this replaces your judgment; it just reduces chaos so your attention can stay on design and story.

          <div class="ea-tag">Render &amp; image pipeline</div>
          <h2>ComfyUI  EnTrusWeb</h2>
          <p>
            Image workflows live in your render space (EnTrusRender). Product and card renders are exported to fixed
            folders, then PowerShell scripts copy or update them into the websites assets, replacing placeholders.
          </p>
          <p>
            This pipeline keeps art and pages in sync without you hunting through folders by hand.

      <p class="ea-block">
        1) You define the story: what Live in Rhythm means for pacing, health, and breath.<br />
        2) You design the hoodie: colors, sigil, phrase placement based on your locked rules.<br />
        3) A product page is generated for it with size/color options and an activation card link.<br />
        4) ComfyUI renders front/back shots and the activation card image into EnTrusRender.<br />
        5) Scripts sync those renders into EnTrusWeb and mark the product as ready.<br />
        6) When someone opens the page, they see the hoodie, the frequency story, and an optional card
           to mark their intent before they wear it.

      <div class="ea-section-label">4  Boundaries and honesty</div>
      <p class="ea-block">
        EnTrus does not promise miracles, healing, or guaranteed outcomes. It does not replace medical, financial,
        or legal advice. It is a design language and a support system for people who want to live with more intention:
        what they wear, what they say, how they move.
      </p>
      <p class="ea-block">
        Guardians, frequencies, and rituals are <strong>metaphors and tools</strong>. How someone uses them, and what
        meaning they find, belongs to them.
      </p>
    </section>

    <p class="ea-note">
      This page exists so future products, campaigns, and collaborations can stay aligned with the original structure:
      honest, grounded, and built to help people choose their path instead of handing them a script.
