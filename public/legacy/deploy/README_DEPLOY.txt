EnTrus Web  Deploy Bundle
==========================

This folder is generated by Layer 7 of the EnTrus system.

Contents
--------

1) site\\
   - A static copy of the main EnTrus site:
     * index.html
     * apparel.html
     * frequencies.html
     * guardian_council.html
     * creator_panel.html (dev use only)
     * origin.html
     * system.html
     * css\\, js\\, assets\\, pages\\ folders

2) entrus_site_static.zip
   - A zip of the contents in site\\
   - Use this for simple static hosting platforms.

How to use
----------

Local preview (recommended for this machine):

  1) In C:\\EnTrusWeb run:
        run_dev_server.cmd
  2) In your browser, open:
        http://localhost:8080

  This serves the live working copy in C:\\EnTrusWeb, not the deploy\\site copy.

Static hosting:

  - Upload the contents of deploy\\site (or the zip) to a static host.
  - Make sure "index.html" is treated as the root homepage.

Notes
-----

- The deploy folder is generated only from local files; no external services
  or secrets are included.
- You can regenerate this bundle at any time by running:
      C:\\EnTrusWeb\\scripts\\entrus_layer7_deploy_setup.ps1
- This bundle is for presentation and testing. Payments, accounts, or
  integrations must be added separately and securely.
